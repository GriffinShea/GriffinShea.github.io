	<div class="column">
		
		<p>In the year 2222, the vicious Bugmen of Bugulon Prime landed on Earth and began slaughtering human populations. The EUBDC (Earth United Bug Defence Coalition) was assembled in order to organize a counteroffensive to these invading forces. The war has been long and brutal but the EUBDC has finally pushed the Bugmen across the stars all the way back to their home planet. All that remains to be done is to eliminate the hive on Bugulon Prime...</p>
		<p>In BUGMAN ASSAULT, <b>YOU</b> have been chosen to take on the role of Field Marshal to lead the EUBDC invasion forces on Bugulon Prime!</p>
		<p>Harvest precious resources from the surface of an alien world. Protect your base from enemy wave assaults or hunt down Bugman scouts (yellow) before they can alert the hive of your location. Expand production by securing distant resources and construct an army of tanks to wipe out the hive and finally bring an end to this brutal war...</p>
		<p>Built in Unity as a course project for COMP-4501 (Advanced Computer Game Design and Development) at Carleton University (February - April 2022).</p>
		<p>Technical Achievements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Developed a real-time strategy game in Unity utilizing game engine functions to fulfill design guidelines and provide a player experience emphasizing strategic resource management and decision making</li>
			<li>Programmed high-level game logic in C# using a component-based architecture to organize and reuse code for update steps and interactions common between object types</li>
			<li>Implemented artificial intelligence and animation using finite-state machines to reduce the complexity of controlling the autonomous behaviors of player-controlled units and enemies</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The repository includes a Windows executable build and the Unity source project folder.</p>

### SVG Curling [code available](https://github.com/GriffinShea/SVG_Curling)
<div class="row">
	<div class="column">
		<p>SVG curling is a two-player digital version of everyone's favourite rock throwing ice sport. Two web browsers connect to a central server that coordinates the shared game state in real-time through a web socket connection. Backend communication logic is carefully defined to avoid deadlocks and disallow abuse from a browser. Developed in Javascript with the .NET framework, graphics are generated using the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) library.</p>
		<p>Created as an assignment for COMP-2406 (Fundamentals of Web Applications) at Carleton University (November 2018).</p>
		<p>The repository contains all the files needed to run the game and a readme file which should instruct you how to run it.</p>

### BLOODHELL [code available](https://github.com/GriffinShea/BLOODHELL)
<div class="row">
	<div class="column">
		<p>Explore a hellish dungeon, but keep your sword drawn and your eyes peeled because danger lurks around every corner. Hack and slash your way through vicious waves of animated Green Slime. Dodge the lethal fire orbs of the tricky Lesser Demon or, if you are brave enough, use your blade to redirect the flame towards your foes! Just make sure to remember to keep an eye out for those precious potions of regeneration...</p>
		<p>Do you have what it takes to escape from BLOODHELL?</p>
		<p>This game was created to fulfil an assignment for COMP-1501 (Introduction to Computer Game Design) at Carleton University (January-February 2018). The task was to elaborate on a simple “toy” program given by the course instructor and use a design workflow inspired by the mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics (MDA) framework for analyzing games to turn this simple mechanic into a full-fledged game.</p>
		<p>The original program which made up the basic gameplay mechanic for BLOODHELL involved a rotating line colliding with circle colliders in 2D space. I incorporated movement for the circles and the origin of the rotating line as well as user input to add dynamics to the gameplay and then decided on a dark fantasy aesthetic to guide myself in filling out the rest of the game.</p>
		<p>The setting hoped to combine elements of Hell and the labyrinthine dungeons found in classic fantasy roleplaying games. I setup basic AI to control the actions of enemies and made simple animations to give them life. To add a final element of challenge I gave the player character the ability to deflect fireballs by hitting them with their sword. Using the deflected fireball to eliminate foes is awarded extra points. I also made sure that a fireball hit by the player’s sword will never deflect towards them because in testing that was found to be not very fun.</p>
		<p>The repository includes the source code as well as a Windows executable so you can try out BLOODHELL for yourself! This was the first game I produced during my time at Carleton so much of the code contains inefficient functions, however I am still quite proud of how I did with this assignment 😊</p>
